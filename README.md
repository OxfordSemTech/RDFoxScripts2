# RDFox Scripts 2
This repository is a companion to an article on Medium and explains how to write scripts for RDFox - an in-memory knowledge graph and reasoning engine created by Oxford Semantic Technologies.

## Getting started with RDFox
You can read about getting started with RDFox in [this](https://medium.com/oxford-semantic-technologies/getting-started-with-rdfox-79adbbfa86b1) article.

## Using this repository
Once you have cloned this repository, add a directory called `output` to make sure RDFox is able to generate output files. 

Then launch RDFox and run the `start.rdfox` script. You can now follow all the examples described in the accompanying article.
